# Welcome to Typescript playbook

## What is this session about?

- Exploring how to use the `type system`
- `Patterns` that can be used to deal with types
- Some basic type system `101` to understand `higher level concepts`

## What is this session NOT about?

- Things `outside` the type system
- While it will cover `some basics` the intent is not to cover code flow

## 101 > Variable type inference

```typescript

let greeting = 'hello world'; 
let myGreeting = () => console.log('hello world');
let myObject = {greeting: 'hello world'};
// this is regular JS code but TS has already inferred and assigned a type to the variables.

greeting = 21321;
myGreeting = 'hello world';
myObject = () => console.log('hello world');
// here we are trying to reassign different types which would make compilation fail

const notNullable: string = null;
// this is not allowed as the variable is not nullable

const nullable: null | string | undefined = null;
// nulls or undefined have to be explicitly allowed
// this is also known as an intersection type where the variable can have one of these values

```

## Questions ?

## 101 > Predefining types

### Interfaces 

```typescript

// defines an object which should have a method
interface IPerson {
    greet(name: string): void;
}

// defines a function 
interface IGreet {
    (name: string): void;
}

```

### Types

```typescript

// defines an object which should have a method
type Person = {
    greet(name: string): void;
}

// defines a function 
type Greet = (name: string) => void;

```

### Classes can also be used as interfaces

```typescript
class WildDuck {

    fly() {
        console.log('fly');
    }

    swim() {
        console.log('swim');
    }
}

class WoodDuck implements WildDuck {
    swim(): void {
        console.log('swim');
    }

    fly(): void {
    }
}

```
